# The Whitelist Project - NFT Mint Site

This project was my first entry into the world of smart contracts, blockchian coding, and NFT generation. This is a basic example of utilizing the CandyMachine made by Metaplex to generate a mint site for an NFT collection. 

It connects your wallet, and directly interacts with the contract on the Solana Blockchain via JavaScript connectors.

The Whitelist Project is a collection of 999 whitelist tickets to be used for exclusive access to Solana NFT mints.
